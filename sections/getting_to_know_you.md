# Getting to know you

I want to learn your names and how you look like.

## Let's play a game â€“ rules:

1. You know your names.
2. I have a list of all names. It's not in alphabetical order and I cannot reorder it.
2. You cannot say your name.
3. You can only say *yes* or *no* when asked something.

What is the fastest way to match everyone's name to their face?

Notes:

* How long does it take if I just try every name on everyone?
* What's the fastest to learn all your names?
