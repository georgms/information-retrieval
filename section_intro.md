# Org

* Some coding homework during the semester.
* Final project: Find data set, build search.
* Participation is relevant for your grade, and helps us learn better. Asking questions is also participation!
* I will pick random people from the [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/) to answer questions during the lecture. This helps up to stay awake.
* Have a question? Too slow? Too fast? Let me know right away!
* I will record the lecture. Ok?
* Who will be my timekeeper? Time to [spin the Wheel](https://wheelofnames.com/).
* When online:
    * Please turn on your cameras. Otherwise, I feel like I'm talking to my computer.
    * Break every ~45 minutes.
