# Getting to know you

I want to learn your names and how you look like. Let's play a game!

#### Rules

1. I have a list of all your names.
2. You know your names.
3. You cannot say your name.
4. You can only say *yes* or *no* when asked something.
5. You can follow my orders silently.

Now I need to *search* for every name in the group and retrieve the person and their face.

What is the fastest way for me to match everyone's name to their face?

Notes:

* How long does it take if I just try every name on everyone?
* What's the fastest to learn all your names?
